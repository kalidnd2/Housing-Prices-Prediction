# Housing-Prices-Prediction

Project Statement and Data Science Solution:
In recent years there has been a great deal of news claiming that individuals are leaving major cities in California in search of cheaper more tax friendly cities. Our Final Projectâ€™s goal is to use population data and housing data to determine if those claims are in fact true, and if so the impact they will have on housing prices for the major cities in California, as well as the major cities in nearby states where we suspect individuals are moving to.

In order to accomplish this we will be using a time series analysis model to predict the housing prices in the largest cities in California as well as in neighboring states. Clustering will be used to find cities with similar trends of increase/decrease in population for the cities and see if we can cluster cities we suspect are decreasing in population together in one cluster and cities which we suspect are increasing in population in another cluster.
